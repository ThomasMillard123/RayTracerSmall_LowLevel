This project explores the methods to debug and improve a ray tracing application. The project was performed on a console application that produced several images that have been produced with ray tracing. 
The visual studio debugger was used to identify area of the code that could be improved. Also, the use of memory tacking with overriding new to add a header and footer for memory allocated. A heap was also used to able to what memory is being used and information relevant to it in the application.
Overall, the application did get improved in its efficiency to do this threading, C styled file loading, using an object pool and good data structures were added.  
The code was also ported to Linux so the use of pipes and forks to improve the application efficacy in Linux environments.
